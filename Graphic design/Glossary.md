### Aspect ratio 
is the proportional relationship between the width and height of an image or screen. It is often expressed as a two-dimensional ratio, such as 4:3 or 16:9. When designing graphics or websites, it is important to be aware of the aspect ratio of the images you are using, as they may not be compatible with all screen sizes.
