## Decision
* There is a possibility for the development of a project in S3 instead of normal class assignments and tests.
* Detail: the project will be based on the unit that that you have completed 3 units in and will be further improving your skills by incorporating other aspects. 
* In the past the people who have made a combination of different subjects eg. physics and robotics
* Archana will send past projects (from last session), rubric
* The project will be divided into the two sections; 
* Section 1: Planning and development worth 40%
* Section 2: Implementation 60%
* This will be ranked and scaled the same as the other assignment items (normal)
* This is offered to only 3 students
* decide by end of term 2

### Ideas
* required real life application to some degree
* make a puzzle game (https://www.instructables.com/Crack-the-Code-Game-Arduino-Based-Puzzle-Box/)
(puzzle for colourblind or diabled? inclusive)
* make a face camera that identifies you, if not allowed it shoots something -->no face camera
* make an alarm that wakes you by sending high frequency sounds at irregular speeds as well as a programmed gun
* capture the flag arduino box. the challenge is web-based and physical. To get inside the box there are two problems which need to be solved; the mastermind type puzzle seen above and [nah]
* puzzle box: the aim is to open the lock, by solving the mastermind puzzle. if time there may be a digital component where the password can be found by ctf
