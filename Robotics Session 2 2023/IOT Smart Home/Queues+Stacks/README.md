Arduino Stacks and Queues Implementation


QueueStack is a file that contains the basic uses of the implementation of a stack and a circular queue. 
- it uses data from a servo to send to a stack/queue and then prints it out

QueueStackPointer is a file that is a copy of the previous file but uses pointers instead.
