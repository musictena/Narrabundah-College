			<h2>Digital Solutions</h2>
			<div class=" big hello">
				<p>This course focuses on computational thinking and the application
					of the design process to create and develop digital solutions using a variety of digital
					technologies.
					Digital Technologies involves students creating new ways of doing things, generating their own ideas
					and creating digital solutions to problems of individual, community and global interest.
					They model, analyse and evaluate data, test hypotheses, make decisions based on evidence,
					and create solutions. Innovative solutions may take the form of a product, prototype, and/or
					proof of concept that allows for improvement or disruption of existing processes or products.
					Students may explore a single technology deeply or may consider many different technologies in
					pursuit of a solution.
					Through the study of Digital Technologies, students present, validate, and evaluate their solutions.
					In doing so, they develop and extend their understanding of designing and programming, including
					fundamental computer science principles such as algorithm selection and complexity, structuring data
					for processing and problem-solving.
					Throughout the course, students are exposed to a range of strategies for managing projects and
					communicating their ideas from ideation to development and launch. Understanding the value of
					collaboration with others and the importance of stakeholder input in the design of a product is
					a critical part of developing any solution, including the selection of appropriate technologies
					and platforms.
