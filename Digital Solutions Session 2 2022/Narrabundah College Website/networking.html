			<h3>Networking</h3>
			<br>
			<p>
				This course focuses on network technologies and architecture, and
				the devices, media and services and operations in different types of networks.
				This course is also more difficult compared to the
				<a href="#" class="tooltip-9">other subjects</a><br><br>
				The rise of mobile computing and ubiquitous internet access has led to
				modern computing systems and platforms that are designed for access anywhere,
				anytime.
				<br>
				These platforms all rely on networks that are not only stable and
				reliable but interconnected and increasingly distributed.
				Understanding networks and the security implications of data transmission
				through networks is a critical part of developing digital solutions for a wide audience.
				<br>
				<br>
				Students learn how networks facilitate device to device communication through an
				exploration of core networking technologies and their configuration. This could
				include the study of embedded systems (Internet of Things devices) alongside
				core networking devices such as routers and switches and the software that
				manages them.
				The security of data and the implications of networked systems for data privacy
				are considered from many perspectives, including the technical implementation
				of secure protocols and the ethical challenges associated with providing
				encrypted communications and storage for all users.
