1. Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. Your program should
have much fewer than 100 lines of code!
```
num = 1

while num <= 100:
    print(num)
    num = num + 1
```
2. Starting with the word GENE1=”ATGTTGATGTG”, write a Python program that
creates the new words GENE2, GENE3, GENE4 and GENE5 such that:
i. GENE2 only contains the last two letters of GENE1
ii. GENE3 only contains the first two letters of GENE1
iii. GENE4 only contains the letters at positions 2,4,6,8 and 10 in GENE1
iv. GENE5 only contains the first 3 and last 3 letters of GENE1



13. Write a function called find value(mydict, val) that accepts a dictionary called mydict and a variable of any type called
val. The function should return a list of keys that map to the value val in mydict.
